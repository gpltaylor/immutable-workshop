## Welcome

Welcome to this Immutable workshop. Our goal is to help everyone make strides towards learning Immutable syntax.

This repo is meant to be used in parallel with a lecture style presentation of
[the new features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features).

## Thanks
The project is cloned from all the hard work done by kentcdodds.. I am just riding on the back of giants.
